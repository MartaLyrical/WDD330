    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>I will use the notes to make comments and annotations regarding what I will be learning in every week.
                <br>This week I learned how to make a menu with the assignments work with Javascript, and display text from a different 
                file in the same page.
